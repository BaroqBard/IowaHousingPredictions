# WIP
This project is currently underway, to be completed soon. Stay tuned!

## Project Goals

The aim of this project is to examine the data of the Iowa Housing dataset and to build a Machine Learning Model to predict house pricing.

Involved in the processing of these data, I employed a variety of tools. The most notable of these were the Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, SKLearn, Seaborne, and Datetime packages. Of further note is the Missingno package, which proved invaluable in the effective visualization of the missing data in the dataset.

## Analysis

I will omit the majority of the analysis here, however, should you wish to examine it further, you may find a fuller breakdown HERE, at my official blog writeup.
